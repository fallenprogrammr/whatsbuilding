=============


TFS seriously lacks a view of all the builds running on a controller, you can only use visual studio to get to the builds per project.

As an administrator / power user, one would want to see the status of all the builds queued up / hung, etc.

This is a Visual Studio 2010 asp.net mvc 4 application allowing you to view all the builds running on a particular tfs project collection.

Currently this is still in its infancy stage, but highly usable and helpful for people who are using tfs and the tfs build system.
